# snake-water-gun
My first Python project: a command-line Snake, Water, Gun game! Challenge the computer's random moves. Type 's' for Snake, 'w' for Water, or 'g' for Gun to play. The winner is decided using conditional logic based on the classic rules: Snake > Water, Water > Gun, &amp; Gun > Snake. A fun exercise in user input and Python basics!
